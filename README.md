## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Motivation
During critical situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, predictive flight fare models can assist travelers in making informed decisions about their travel plans by accounting for dynamic pricing and travel restrictions.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Pythonaanywhere
